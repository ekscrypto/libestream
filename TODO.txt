- Better testing on buffered_skip().
- Increase chunk size of hc-128 to 64 bytes, in order to dilute overhead.
- Test of sum_mod_p128 with y == out.
- On uhash_<bits>_update, aviod copying string to buffer if possible.
- Find some way to test UMAC better. Reference implementation seems broken
when (m >= maxwordrange) on POLY algorithm (rarelly occurs, I don't know of any case, neither how to craft it). Test vectors doesn't cover all branches.
- UHASH buffer can be as small as 32 bytes, instead of current 1024. Make it so.
- Change UHASH interface to choose dynamically between variants, instead of the ugly macros used until now to generate specific functions.
