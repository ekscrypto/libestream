- Better testing on buffered_skip().
- Increase chunk size of hc-128 to 64 bytes, in order to dilute overhead.
- Test of sum_mod_p128 with y == out.
- Find some way to test UMAC better. Reference implementation seems broken
when (m >= maxwordrange) on POLY algorithm (rarelly occurs, I don't know of any case, neither how to craft it). Test vectors doesn't cover all branches.
- Test UMAC with all input sizes, from 0 to 3000, generating the input randomly.
- Static initalizator to UHASH state.
