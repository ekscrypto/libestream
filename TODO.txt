- Better testing on buffered_skip().
- Increase chunk size of hc-128 to 64 bytes, in order to dilute overhead.
- Test of sum_mod_p128 with y == out.
- On uhash_<bits>_update, aviod copying string to buffer if possible.
- Find some way to test umac better. Reference implementation seems broken
when (m >= maxwordrange) on POLY algorithm (rarelly occurs, I don't know of any case, neither how to craft it). Test vectors doesn't cover all branches.
- Better organize directory structure, specially tests.
